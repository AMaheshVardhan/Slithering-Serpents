Snake Game
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the turtle graphics module. The game involves controlling a snake and guiding it to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls and its own tail. The objective is to grow the snake as long as possible and achieve a high score.

Game controls:

Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
Guide the snake to the food (blue circles) to eat and grow.
Avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own tail, as they will end the game.
Scoring: The score increases by 1 each time the snake eats food. The current score is displayed on the screen.

Game over: The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own tail. The final score and "GAME OVER" message will be displayed on the screen.

Customization
Game settings: You can modify various game settings by editing the main.py file. For example, you can change the screen size, background color, snake speed, etc.

Adding new features: The code is modular and organized into different classes (Snake, Food, Scoreboard). You can extend the game by adding new features or functionalities to these classes.
